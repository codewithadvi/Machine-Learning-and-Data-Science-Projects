List five use cases to practice file handling concepts in python

Here are five practical use cases for practicing file handling concepts in Python:

1. **Text File Management**: Create, read, write, and append text files to manage simple data logs or notes.

2. **CSV File Processing**: Use the `csv` module to read from and write to CSV files, which is essential for handling tabular data.

3. **JSON Data Manipulation**: Read and write JSON files using Python's `json` module to manage structured data easily.

4. **Binary File Handling**: Work with binary files (e.g., images) to understand how to read and write non-text data.

5. **Directory Operations**: Utilize the `os` module for file and directory manipulation tasks such as creating, renaming, or deleting files and directories[1][4][9].


6. **Log File Analyzer**: Write a script that reads server log files, extracts specific information (like error messages or access times), and summarizes the data in a report format.

7. **File Backup Utility**: Create a program that copies files from one directory to another, implementing features like checking for existing files and creating timestamped backups.

8. **Text File Search Tool**: Develop a tool that searches for specific keywords or phrases in a text file and returns the lines containing those keywords, along with their line numbers.

9. **Data Serialization with Pickle**: Use the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize Python objects, allowing you to save complex data structures (like lists or dictionaries) to a file and retrieve them later.

10. **Batch File Renamer**: Create a script that renames multiple files in a directory based on specific criteria (e.g., adding prefixes/suffixes or changing file extensions), enhancing your understanding of file path manipulation. 

These use cases will help you deepen your understanding of file handling in Python while providing practical applications for your skills!
