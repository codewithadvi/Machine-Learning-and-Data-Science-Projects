### 1. **House Price Prediction** üè°
This project predicts the sale price of houses based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The model is trained using a real estate dataset and evaluated using performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). It aims to provide insights into how certain factors influence house prices.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Dataset**: Kaggle House Price Prediction dataset

For more details, check out the README in the project folder!

### 2. **Music Popularity Prediction Model** üé∂
This project uses machine learning to predict how likely a song is to become popular, based on features like genre, artist, tempo, and audio characteristics. It helps understand what factors contribute to a song‚Äôs success on the charts.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Key Techniques**: Regression Analysis, Feature Engineering
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Music Dataset

Explore the project folder for a step-by-step guide on how the model was built.

### 3. **Sarcasm Detection System** üòè
In this project, I built a model that detects sarcasm in text. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model is trained on a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences to identify sarcastic remarks in real-world text, such as social media posts and reviews.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLP, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Key Techniques**: Text Preprocessing, Word Embeddings, Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Sarcasm Detection Dataset

Visit the README inside the folder to see how I tackled sarcasm detection!

### 4. **Stress Detection System** üß†
This project aims to detect stress levels using physiological data and facial expressions. The model can be used to monitor stress levels in real-time, potentially assisting with mental health management.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow
- **Key Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Image Processing (Facial Expression Analysis), Neural Networks
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset or publicly available datasets

For more information on the approach and results, check the project's README.

### 5. **Titanic Survival Prediction** üö¢
Using the Titanic dataset, this project predicts the likelihood of a passenger surviving based on features like age, gender, and class. It's a popular beginner project that helps in understanding classification algorithms and model evaluation.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Cross-Validation
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Titanic dataset

The README in the folder will guide you through the details and model implementation.

### 6. **Heart Disease Prediction Web App** ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical features like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. Users input their health data, and the app gives a prediction of their risk, making it a useful tool for early heart disease detection.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Web App Development
- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset

For a full overview of the app, including how to run it and interact with the model, check the README in the project folder.
