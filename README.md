### 1. **House Price Prediction**
In this project, the goal is to predict the sale price of houses based on various features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, neighborhood, and age of the house. The dataset used contains historical data of real estate transactions, which has been processed and cleaned to create a feature set for training a machine learning model. The model is evaluated using several performance metrics, including RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning, Feature Engineering
- **Dataset**: Kaggle’s House Price Prediction dataset or a custom real estate dataset

Each model in this project is thoroughly explained in its individual README. Please refer to the respective project folder for detailed instructions on running and understanding the model.

### 2. **Music Popularity Prediction Model**
This project aims to predict how popular a song will be based on features such as genre, tempo, artist, and other audio characteristics. The model was trained on a large dataset of songs, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that influence the popularity of songs. The model helps predict the success of a song based on its audio features, which can be helpful for music production companies and artists.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Key Techniques**: Regression Analysis, Feature Selection, Model Evaluation with MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle’s Music Dataset or a custom audio features dataset

You can find a detailed explanation of the approach and methodology used in the respective README within the project folder.

### 3. **Sarcasm Detection System**
The goal of this project is to detect sarcasm in text, a challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Sarcasm is difficult for machines to understand because it involves subtleties such as tone, context, and irony. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences, using advanced NLP techniques. This model can be used to detect sarcastic remarks in social media posts, customer reviews, or any textual data where sarcasm may be present.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, NLP, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Key Techniques**: Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Lemmatization), Feature Extraction (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings), Deep Learning (LSTM, CNN)
- **Dataset**: Custom text dataset or Kaggle’s Sarcasm Detection dataset

Each step in building the sarcasm detection system is documented in detail within the README of the respective project folder.

### 4. **Stress Detection System**
This project uses machine learning to detect stress levels based on various data inputs such as user behavior, heart rate, or facial features. The stress detection system could be applied in mental health applications, offering real-time monitoring of stress levels and providing insights into potential interventions. The model uses a variety of input features to predict stress, and the results are evaluated for accuracy and reliability.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, Scikit-Learn
- **Key Techniques**: Feature Engineering, Image Processing (for facial expression analysis), Regression Models, Neural Networks
- **Dataset**: Custom dataset or publicly available datasets such as facial expression datasets, heart rate datasets, etc.

For a complete breakdown of the model’s structure and functionality, please refer to the README file within the Stress Detection project folder.

### 5. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
In this well-known project, I use the Titanic dataset to predict the likelihood of a passenger’s survival based on features like age, gender, class, and number of siblings. The Titanic dataset is a popular entry-level problem for anyone new to machine learning, as it provides a clean, labeled dataset for classification tasks. Various machine learning algorithms were employed to predict survival, and model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), Model Evaluation (Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Titanic dataset

The Titanic Survival Prediction project has its own README where you can find detailed steps on how to run the model, data preprocessing, and results analysis.

### 6. **Heart Disease Prediction Web App**
This project features a web application built using Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of medical features, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators. The app allows users to input their health data and get a prediction of whether they are at risk of heart disease. This web app is an example of how machine learning models can be deployed in real-world applications, providing valuable insights for early detection and prevention of heart disease.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Techniques**: Classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), Data Preprocessing, Web App Development (Streamlit)
- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease dataset or a custom medical dataset

This project is fully documented in its own README file, where you can find instructions for running the app, interacting with the model, and exploring the code.
