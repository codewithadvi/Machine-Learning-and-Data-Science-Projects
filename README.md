Machine Learning & Data Science Projects:
Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) projects! Here, you'll find a variety of explorative and predictive projects covering topics like regression, classification, clustering, NLP, and more. Each project is well-documented, includes data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation techniques.

Featured Projects:
Movie Ratings Prediction: Predicts movie ratings based on factors like director and actors, using advanced regression techniques.
Star Type Classification: Classifies stars based on attributes such as color, temperature, and luminosity, using supervised learning.
Song Popularity Prediction: Determines song popularity by analyzing various musical and categorical features.
Repository Structure
/data: Contains datasets and any feature-engineered versions for each project.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA, model training, and results.
/scripts: Python scripts for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
