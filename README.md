# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Data Science (DS)** projects! Here, you'll find a variety of explorative and predictive projects covering topics like **regression**, **classification**, **clustering**, **NLP**, and more. Each project is well-documented, with steps including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and evaluation.

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects

- **[Movie Ratings Prediction](link)**: *Predicts movie ratings based on factors like director and actors, using advanced regression techniques.*
- **[Star Type Classification](link)**: *Classifies stars based on attributes such as color, temperature, and luminosity, using supervised learning.*
- **[Song Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/codewithadvi/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/music-popularity-prediction%20(1).ipynb)**: *Determines song popularity by analyzing various musical and categorical features.*
- **[Stress Detection](https://github.com/codewithadvi/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/stress-detection-model.ipynb)**: *A machine learning model that detects stress levels based on various physiological and behavioral inputs, helping identify early signs of stress for timely intervention.*

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`/data`**: Contains datasets and any feature-engineered versions for each project.
- **`/notebooks`**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed EDA, model training, and results.
- **`/scripts`**: Python scripts for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
