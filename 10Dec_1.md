It's not entirely reasonable to expect a beginner to write the entire code independently for any program, especially considering the complexity of techniques involved. However, with a solid foundation in Python basics and a willingness to learn, a beginner can definitely tackle this project with some guidance.
Here's a more realistic breakdown of what a beginner might be able to accomplish for eg. in a usecase of Analyzing Whatsapp Chat / System Logs ..etc.. 
1. Basic Understanding of Python:
 * Core Concepts: Variables, data types, control flow (if-else, loops), functions, and file I/O.
 * String Manipulation: Basic string operations like slicing, indexing, and splitting.
2. Regular Expressions:
 * Introduction to Regular Expressions: Understanding the syntax and basic patterns.
 * Simple Pattern Matching: Using regular expressions to identify simple patterns in text.
3. Data Structures:
 * Lists and Dictionaries: Using these data structures to store the parsed information.
4. Code Structure:
 * Breaking Down the Problem: Identifying the steps involved in parsing the chat.
 * Writing Clear and Concise Code: Using meaningful variable names and comments.
With these foundational skills, a beginner could start by:
 * Manually parsing a small sample of the chat data to understand the structure.
 * Writing simple code to extract basic information like timestamps and sender names.
 * Using regular expressions to identify more complex patterns, such as message content.
 * Creating a basic data structure to store the parsed information.
However, to create a robust and efficient parser, a beginner might need to:
 * Refer to documentation and tutorials for regular expressions and advanced text processing techniques.
 * Experiment with different regular expression patterns to handle variations in the chat format.
 * Consider using libraries like re or pandas to simplify the parsing process.
 * Test the code with various chat formats to ensure its reliability.
It's important to remember that learning is a gradual process. By starting with smaller, achievable steps and gradually increasing the complexity, a beginner can successfully tackle this project and gain valuable experience in Python programming.
