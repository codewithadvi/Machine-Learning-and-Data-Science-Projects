## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using Scikit-learn with real-world heart disease data.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A user-friendly and interactive web interface.
- **Prediction**: Provides results based on the trained ML model.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Python
  - Scikit-learn
  - Streamlit

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users enter key health metrics (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
2. **Prediction**: The ML model processes the input and predicts the probability of heart disease.
3. **Result**: The output is displayed on the web app with an easy-to-read interface.

Project Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

The dataset used was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure high accuracy.
Model Training:

A classification model was built using Scikit-learn and achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset.
Web App Development:

The trained model was integrated with a web application built using Streamlit for user interaction.
Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and building the ML model.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning.
Streamlit: For creating the web app interface.
