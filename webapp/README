## How It Works ðŸ”§
1. The machine learning model was trained on a heart disease dataset using **scikit-learn**.
2. After achieving high accuracy, the model was saved and integrated into the Streamlit web app.
3. Users can input relevant health parameters (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure) on the app.
4. The app processes the inputs and provides a prediction of the likelihood of heart disease.
