# ü§ñ Sarcasm Detection System

Welcome to the **Sarcasm Detection System**! This project leverages **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** and **CountVectorizer** to analyze input text and classify it as **sarcastic** or **not sarcastic**. The system demonstrates how simple yet powerful machine learning techniques can tackle sentiment analysis and text classification problems.

## üåü Overview

The **Sarcasm Detection System** uses a **Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier**, a probabilistic algorithm, to classify text based on binary features extracted from input text. The features are generated using **CountVectorizer**, which transforms the input text into a matrix of token counts. This project is an excellent starting point for understanding text processing and applying machine learning to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## üõ† How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The input text is cleaned and transformed into a bag-of-words representation using **CountVectorizer**.
   - Each word is treated as a binary feature (present or absent in the input).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **CountVectorizer** converts the text into a sparse binary matrix where each column represents a word.

3. **Classification**:
   - A **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** classifier is trained on a sarcasm dataset to predict the likelihood of the input being sarcastic or not.
   - The algorithm works well for binary features (present/absent), making it ideal for this application.

4. **Output**:
   - The system returns a label (`Sarcastic` or `Not Sarcastic`) along with a confidence score.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

1. **Input**:
   - Enter a sentence or phrase into the system.
   - Example: `"Oh, I just *love* when my coffee spills!"`

2. **Output**:
   - The system will classify the input as:
     - **Sarcastic**: Indicates the input contains sarcasm.
     - **Not Sarcastic**: Indicates the input is straightforward.

3. **Workflow**:
   - The input text is vectorized using CountVectorizer.
   - The classifier predicts the output based on the trained Bernoulli Naive Bayes model.
